# principal component analysis(PCA):
- PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify complex datasets.
- it transforms the data into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components that captures most variance in the data.
- it's useful for reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information ,making it ideal for visualization and speeding up machine learning.


# TIME SERIES;
- time series data consists of observations made sequentially over time.
- it's is used to analyze trends,patterns and seasonal effects in data that are collected at consistent time intervals.
- time series  analysis helps in forecasting future values based on historical data commonly applied in finance ,weather prediction,and economics.

# CLUSTERING:
- clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points into cluster based on their similarity.
- the goal is to identify natural grouping  within a dataset without predefined labels.
